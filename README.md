I am a Full-Stack Web Developer based in Chicago IL. I am currently studying Computer Science with a Software Engineering concentration at The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC).

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
**Languages:** C, C++, Python, Java, MySQL

###  About Me
I'm a sophomore currently exploring different areas of computer science and building projects to strengthen my full-stack skills. I'm actively looking for an **entry-level** or **QA/QC internship** where I can learn, contribute, and figure out which CS field excites me most.
