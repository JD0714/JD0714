## Hi there 👋

I am a Full-Stack Web Developer based in Chicago IL. I am currently studying Computer Science with a Software Engineering concentration at The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). I'm currently working building small front-end and full-stack websites to expand my knowledge in Node.js and React.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
**Languages:** C, C++, Python, Java, MySQL
**Web:** HTML, CSS  
**Currently Learning:** JavaScript, JSX, React, Node.js

###  About Me
I'm a sophomore currently exploring different areas of computer science and building projects to strengthen my full-stack skills. I'm actively looking for an **entry-level** or **QA/QC internship** where I can learn about a different area of CS as well as contribute to a company's work.

### Recent Projects
* FunPage : A static page implementing a React framework to make flexible, interactive widgets. Just some practice for future projects using React.
* myNewRepo : A full-stack page using Node.js to connect a web-hosted database and an interactive website. I'm currently working on a home page for the webstie where I will make a table for each user's workout logs.
